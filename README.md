# MVP : Minimum Viable Product

## üìå Overview
The MVP is about all the website structure and front.
It concerns :
   - HTML web page
   - PHP for request to the database
   - CSS for the style

## Installation
### node.js and npm
MESSAGE A ARTHUR : je n'ai pas pu retraiter ce point car j'ai pass√© plus de temps que pr√©vu mais voici n√©anmoins ce que je peux dire.

Requests in our web pages are done in node.js
To **install node.js (and npm)** on Windows :
   - go to : https://nodejs.org/en/download
   - select the last LTS version (LTS is more stable than Current version) for Windows using "fnm" with "npm"
   - download clicking on "Windows installer (.msi)"
   - follow the information of the installer

After installation : 
   - open a PowerShell terminal
   - type : ```node -v```, if your version is not written there is a problem
   - type : ```npm -v```, if your version is not written there is a problem

### MySQL
To install mysql : 
   - open your PowerShell terminal
   - type : ```npm install mysql``` (in the good directory, I don't know where actually, I will say you very soon)



### General & database
To use the website and install it, please launch your Windows OS and read the next steps :
   1. Launch Windows
   2. in **C:\wamp64\www** : clone this git repository (necessary for wampserver to acces to the project). A directory "\FDE" will appear
   3. launch **WampServer64** : if you don't have the app, install it
   4. Install (temporary) database :
      - on your browser, write in URL : **"localhost"**
      - click on : **"PhpMyAdmin X.X.X"** (X.X.X is the version of php)
      if it does not work : try to write **"http://localhost/phpmyadmin/"** in the URL field
      - PhpMyAdmin connection : 
         - login : **"root"**
         - password : **""** (nothing)
      - click on "Import" at the top
      - choose this file in the project : ".../www/FDE/Database/**fde_database.sql**"

Now the database is installed and you can use the website.

**Information** : we have actually a new database but the old is in */Database/OLD_database/* because web pages are still based on this old database. It will change in a few time ...

### Email
Emails are sent to the user when :
   - he wants to create an account
   - he forgots his password

You have to put the key file named "**.env**" in : ...\www\FDE\cy-love-main\Mails  

ATTENTION : This file is ignored for push and commit because he includes sensitive informations about the email address use such as :
   - sender email adress
   - password of this email adress
If you want the file, please ask Thomas to send you the file in private.

## Website main pages
index.php : main page  
login.php : page of login  
register.php : page of register  
search.php : use to search something (not used now)  

session_lifespan.js  
+session_lifespan.php  
+logout_session_expired.php : used for auto disconnection after 10 minutes of inactivity  


header.php : top of all pages (with logos and nav menu)
account_icon_bar.php : nav menu (on the left) for connected peaople




# FDE - IoT Device Simulation & Server

## üìå Overview
This project consists of X main components:
1. **Main serv (Node.js-based)**
2. **IoT Device Simulation (Python-based)**
3. **IoT Server (Node.js-based)**

Each component requires specific dependencies to be installed before running.

---

## üöÄ IoT Device Simulation (Python)
### **Purpose**
This component is responsible for IoT simulation, specifically simulating power plants as REST APIs.

### **Functionality**
The APIs currently provide three endpoints:
1. `/` - Returns the type of power plant, its ID, and name.
2. `/getStatus` - Returns data about the power plant, e.g., `{ "date": 12354686, "prod": 413.53, "target": 0.5, "usage": 0.25 }`
3. `/setTarget` - Allows modification of the power plant's production target.

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install **Python** (if not already installed) ‚Üí [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the required modules:
   ```sh
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

### **Running the IoT Simulation**
After installing the dependencies, run `deviceManager.py`. To stop all simulations and APIs, simply provide any input in the script.

---

## üåê IoT Server (Node.js)
### **Purpose**
This component is responsible for requesting all APIs of the IoT devices to update the database.

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install **Node.js** (if not already installed) ‚Üí [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install axios express
   ```

### **Running the IoT Server**
After installing the dependencies, start the Express.js server:
```sh
node server.js
```

**Note:** Make sure you are in the `iot-device` folder before running the command.
