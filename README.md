# FDE - IoT Device Simulation & Server

## üìå Overview
This project consists of X main components:
1. **Main serv (Node.js-based)**
2. **IoT Device Simulation (Python-based)**
3. **IoT Server (Node.js-based)**

Each component requires specific dependencies to be installed before running.

---

## üöÄ IoT Device Simulation (Python)
### **Purpose**
This component is responsible for IoT simulation, specifically simulating power plants as REST APIs.

### **Functionality**
The APIs currently provide three endpoints:
1. `/` - Returns the type of power plant, its ID, and name.
2. `/getStatus` - Returns data about the power plant, e.g., `{ "date": 12354686, "prod": 413.53, "target": 0.5, "usage": 0.25 }`
3. `/setTarget` - Allows modification of the power plant's production target.

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install **Python** (if not already installed) ‚Üí [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the required modules:
   ```sh
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

### **Running the IoT Simulation**
After installing the dependencies, run `deviceManager.py`. To stop all simulations and APIs, simply provide any input in the script.

## üåê IoT Server (Node.js)
### **Purpose**
This component is responsible for requesting all APIs of the IoT devices to update the database.

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install **Node.js** (if not already installed) ‚Üí [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install axios express
   ```

### **Running the IoT Server**
After installing the dependencies, start the Express.js server:
```sh
node server.js
```

**Note:** Make sure you are in the `iot-device` folder before running the command.
